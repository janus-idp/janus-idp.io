Backstage already contains the functionality to connect to external identity providers to enable authentication and apply proper RBAC. However, these concerns are not the sole role of identity management in relation to development portals. These portals also focus on accountability, responsibility and relationship of users and contributors to their project. Backstage achieves that through entity relations within a service catalog. All actors and objects are modeled as entities in this catalog and the Keycloak plugin ensures that all of your Keycloak users and groups are properly represented and mapped within the catalog. It allows the Backstage instance to interface with Keycloak directly and perform automatic and recurring importing of assets. Once imported, these user and group entities can be used in the standard Backstage catalog model with the added benefits of Keycloak\u2019s diverse identity brokering capabilities."),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"multicluster-engine-plugin-for-backstage"},"MultiCluster Engine plugin for Backstage"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"One of the key focus areas for Backstage is the ability to provide a full, transparent service catalog to their developers.
